% Abbreviations.
%
% Some commands that are common abbreviations, similar to the \iif command.
% Some commands that are often used in scientific/mathematical writing
% are absolutely *never* to be used in written documents! (They are ok on
% the white/black board or in lecture scripts.)
%
% Some other abbreviations are allowed to be used in formal texts. The
% following definitions take care for correct spacing. If the abbreviations
% makes sense to be used at the start of a sentence, they are available in
% capital and minor initial letters.
\newcommand{\ie}{i.\nolinebreak[4]\hspace{0.125em}\nolinebreak[4]e.,\@\xspace}
\newcommand{\Ie}{I.\nolinebreak[4]\hspace{0.125em}\nolinebreak[4]e.,\@\xspace}
\newcommand{\eg}{e.\nolinebreak[4]\hspace{0.125em}\nolinebreak[4]g.,\@\xspace}
% The following abbreviations should *never* be used in written documents!

% Index definitions.
% The \idx command writes a word and at the same time adds it to the index 
\newcommand{\idx}[1]{\index{#1}#1}
% The \eidx writes a word and at the same time uses a different word for the
% index. Use if a word is used in a different grammatical form than used in
% the index.
\newcommand{\eidx}[2]{\index{#2}#1}
% Highlights a word using \emph and places it in the index
\newcommand{\emphidx}[1]{\index{#1}\emph{#1}}
% Highlights a word and uses a different word for the index. See \eids
\newcommand{\empheidx}[2]{\index{#2}\emph{#1}}
% Add own index versions here, for definitions, problems, different styles
