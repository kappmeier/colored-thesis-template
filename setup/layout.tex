% Paragraph formatting.
% This style sets a paragraph to be semi bold in the main color. It does not
% look to heavy. Also, paragraph headlines are not on their own line but end
% with a . (dot) and after a shor space the paragraph text begins. Each
% paragraph will have a small skip space above. It is intended that paragraphs
% are used extensively.
