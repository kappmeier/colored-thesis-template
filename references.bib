	abstract = {For the earliest arrival flow problem one is given a network G = ( V , A ) with capacities u ( a ) and transit times τ ( a ) on its arcs a ∈ A , together with a source and a sink vertex s , t ∈ V . The objective is to send flow from s to t that moves through the network over time, such that for each time θ ∈ [ 0 , T ) the maximum possible amount of flow up to this time reaches t. If, for each θ ∈ [ 0 , T ) , this flow is a maximum flow for time horizon θ , then it is called earliest arrival flow. In practical applications a higher congestion of an arc in the network often implies a considerable increase in transit time. Therefore, in this paper we study the earliest arrival problem for the case that the transit time of each arc in the network at each time θ depends on the flow on this particular arc at that time θ .

For constant transit times it has been shown by Gale that earliest arrival flows exist for any network. We give examples, showing that this is no longer true for flow-dependent transit times. For that reason we define a relaxed version of this problem where the objective is to find flows that are almost earliest arrival flows. In particular, we are interested in flows that, for each θ ∈ [ 0 , T ) , need only α -times longer to send the maximum flow to the sink. We give both constant lower and upper bounds on α ; furthermore, we present a constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem.},

Given a network with capacities and transit times on the arcs, a subset of source nodes with supplies and a sink node, the task is to send the given supplies from the sources to the sink “as quickly as possible.” The latter requirement is made more precise by the earliest arrival property, which requires that the total amount of flow that has arrived at the sink is maximal for all points in time simultaneously. It is a classical result from the 1970s that, for the special case of a single source node, earliest arrival flows do exist and can be computed by essentially applying the successive shortest-path algorithm for min-cost flow computations. Although it has previously been observed that an earliest arrival flow still exists for multiple sources, the problem of computing one efficiently has been open for many years. We present an exact algorithm for this problem whose running time is strongly polynomial in the input plus output size of the problem.},

	abstract = {Cellular Automata ({CA}) has recently emerged as a technique for modeling complex behavior using a set of simple rules. {CA} is named after the principle of "automata" (entities) occupying "cells" according to localized neighborhood rules of occupancy. The {CA} local rules prescribe the behavior of automata creating an approximation of actual behavior. Emergent group behavior is an outgrowth of the interaction of the microsimulation rule set. Unlike traditional simulation models that apply equations and not behavioral rules, {CA} behavior-based cellular changes of state determine the emergent results. Furthermore, {CA} models function as discrete idealizations of the partial differential equations that describe fluid flows and allow simulation of flows and interactions that are otherwise intractable. This paper presents {CA} microsimulation models of uni- and bi-directional pedestrian walkways to demonstrate the ability of capturing fundamental properties of pedestrian movements using a fairly simple rule-based approach. The paper begins by characterizing the pedestrian flow problem. A brief literature review of previous modeling efforts is provided. The formulations for the uni- and bi-directional walkway cases are described. This is followed by a discussion of results gathered from numerous simulation experiments. Included is a comparison of emergent flow patterns to the fundamental parameters described in the Highway Capacity Manual (1994).{\textless}p /{\textgreater}},

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push -relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.},

This is the question tackled in the quickest transshipment problem. Hoppe and Tardos [ Math. Oper.

They actually solve the significantly harder problem in which it takes a prespecified amount of time for flow to travel from one end of an arc to the other. Their algorithm repeatedly calls an oracle for submodular function minimization. We present an algorithm that finds a quickest transshipment with a polynomial number of maximum flow computations, and a faster algorithm that also uses minimum cost flow computations. When there is only one sink, we show how the algorithm can be sped up to return a solution using O(k) maximum flow computations, where k is the number of {sources.Hajek} and Ogier [Networks, 14 (1984), pp. 457--487] describe an algorithm that finds a fractional solution to the single sink quickest transshipment problem on a network with n nodes and m arcs using O(n) maximum flow computations. They actually solve the universally quickest transshipment---a flow over time that minimizes the amount of supply left in the network at every moment of time. In this paper, we show how to solve the universally quickest transshipment in O(mnlog(n2 /m)) time, the same asymptotic time as a push-relabel maximum flow computation.,  A transshipment problem with demands that exceed network capacity can be solved by sending flow in several waves.

The problem formulation and the algorithmic framework presented are quite general; they apply to {IP}, {ATM}, and optical networks.

	abstract = {The earliest arrival flow problem is motivated by evacuation planning. It asks for a flow over time in a network with supplies and demands that maximizes the satisfied demands at every point in time. Gale [1959] has shown the existence of such flows for networks with a single source and sink. For multiple sources and a single sink the existence follows from work by Minieka [1973] and an exact algorithm has been presented by Baumann and Skutella [{FOCS{\textasciitilde}'06].} If multiple sinks are present, it is known that earliest arrival flows do not exist in general.

 We address the open question of approximating earliest arrival flows in arbitrary networks with multiple sinks and present constructive approximations of time and value for them. We give tight bounds for the best possible approximation factor in most cases. In particular, we show that there is always a 2-value-approximation of earliest arrival flows and that no better approximation factor is possible in general. Furthermore, we describe an {FPTAS} for computing the best possible approximation factor (which might be better than 2) along with the corresponding flow for any given instance.},

	abstract = {Flows over time generalize classical “static” network flows by introducing a temporal dimension. They can thus be used to model non-instantaneous travel times for flow and variation of flow values over time, both of which are crucial characteristics in many real-world routing problems. There exist two different models of flows over time with respect to flow conservation: one where flow might be stored temporarily at intermediate nodes and a stricter model where flow entering an intermediate node must instantaneously progress to the next arc. While the first model is in general easier to handle, the second model is often more realistic since in applications like, e.g., road traffic, storage of flow at intermediate nodes is undesired or even prohibited. The main contribution of this paper is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme ({FPTAS}) for (min-cost) multi-commodity flows over time without intermediate storage. This improves upon the best previously known (2 + ε)-approximation algorithm presented 10 years ago by Fleischer and Skutella ({IPCO} 2002).},

Furthermore, the problem, which is shown to be at least as hard as {NP}-complete problems, is generic to a class of problems that arise in the solution of integer linear programs and discrete state/stage deterministic dynamic programs. One approach to solving the problem is to utilize a kth shortest path algorithm, terminating with the first path that satisfies the constraint. This approach is impractical when the terminal value of k is large. Using Lagrangian relaxation we propose a method that is designed to reduce this value of k. Computational results indicate orders of magnitude savings when the approach is applied to large networks.},

The problem involves warehouse selection, fleet routing, and scheduling so as to meet demand in the strict time window. The problem is {NP}-hard, in general, and extremely difficult to solve. The congestion caused by heavy traffic further aggravates the problem. To obtain a scalable solution, a new method based on successive subproblem solving in Lagrangian Relaxation ({LR}) framework is developed. The route capacity and location selection constraints are relaxed by Lagrange multipliers, and the problem is converted into a two-level optimization problem. The subproblems at the lower level are solved successively in dual iterations with convergence assurance so that the indecomposable location constraints can be incorporated. A systematic method is developed to obtain a feasible solution by adding the once relaxed constraints back into the dual problem successively in feasibility iterations. Convergence proof of the new method and its properties are presented. Numerical results show that the new method is effective and efficient, and can be applied to large-scale problems.},

The problem is to send exactly the right amount of flow out of each source and into each sink in the minimum overall time. Variations of the quickest transshipment problem have been studied extensively; the special case of the problem with a single sink is commonly used to model building evacuation. Similar dynamic network flow problems have numerous other applications; in some of these, the capacities are small integers and it is important to find integral flows. There are no polynomial-time algorithms known for most of these problems. In this paper we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for the quickest transshipment problem. Our algorithm provides an integral optimum flow. Previously, the quickest transshipment problem could only be solved efficiently in the special case of a single source and single sink.},

Each arc is equipped with a transit time that specifies how long flow takes to traverse it, while flow rates may vary over time within the given edge capacities. This article extends the concept of an optimization problem over time to the more general setting of abstract flows. In this model, the underlying network is replaced by an abstract system of linearly ordered sets, called “paths” satisfying a simple switching property: Whenever two paths P and Q intersect, there must be another path that is contained in the beginning of P and the end of Q.

We show that a maximum abstract flow over time can be obtained by solving a weighted abstract flow problem and constructing a temporally repeated flow from its solution. In the course of the proof, we also show that the relatively modest switching property of abstract networks already captures many essential properties of classic networks.},

	title = {A Cellular Automaton Model for Crowd Movement and Egress Simulation},
	abstract = {The movement of crowds is a field of research that attracts increasing interest. This is due to three major reasons: pattern formation and self organization processes that occur in crowd dynamics, the advancement of simulation techniques and hardware that enable fast and realistic simulations, and finally the growing area of potential applications (planning of pedestrian facilities, crowd management, or evacuation analysis). The field is spanning the borders of various disciplines: physiology, psychology, sociology, civil engineering, mathematics, physics, etc. It depends on the point of view which aspects are given the main focus. One approach is to reduce complexity to fundamental principles that make a mathematical (quantitative) formulation possible and at the same time are sufficiently complex to reproduce the majo phenomena that can observed in reality.
The major aim of this dissertation is to define and validate a model for the simulation of evacuation processes and their analysis. To this end the analogy between non-equilibrium many particle systems and crowds is used. However, it will also become clear that this analogy is not sufficient for complex scenarios and realistic egress simulations and additional, ‘non-physical’, parameters and principles must be introduced. Even though the investigation is motivated by the applications, the dynamics of crowd movement and model properties are scrutinized. This also includes a thorough review of the data available in the literature, the calibration of the model parameters and the comparison of simulated and empirical flow-density relations.
The core of any evacuation simulation is a set of rules or equations for the movement of people. This is connected to the representation of space, population, and behavior. These topics will be investigated generally (micro- vs. macroscopic, discrete vs. continuous) and especially with regard to a specific two-dimensional cellular automaton model, where the movement dynamics is based on discrete space and time. This allows an efficient implementation and therefore large scale simulations. The route-choice is done via the orientation along a discrete vector field which can in principal be derived from a discrete potential. It is therefore not explicitly simulated but taken into account in a pre-determined way, i.e., the coupling to the vector field is static (constant coupling parameter). In addition to the model characteristics, extensions like competition, multiple and dynamically varying orientation potentials or coupling parameters, or individual egress routes are discussed.
In order to validate the simulation results and the application to full-scale problems, simulations for realistic scenarios are performed and compared to data from evacuation trials. Design variants, aspects of crowd management, or operational measures to optimize evacuation performance are also mentioned. However, they are the task of experts (architects, psychologists, safety engineers) who might use simulations as a design and evaluation tool. Therefore, these results are rather case studies supplementing the major topics of the model characteristics and implementation.},

Research in this area has been pursued in two different and mainly independent directions with respect to time modeling: discrete and continuous time models. In this paper we deploy measure theory in order to introduce a general model of network flows over time combining both discrete and continuous aspects into a single model. Here, the flow on each arc is modeled as a Borel measure on the real line (time axis) which assigns to each suitable subset a real value, interpreted as the amount of flow entering the arc over the subset. We focus on the maximum flow problem formulated in a network where capacities on arcs are also given as Borel measures and storage might be allowed at the nodes of the network. We generalize the concept of cuts to the case of these Borel Flows and extend the famous {MaxFlow}-{MinCut} Theorem.},

In flows over time (also called dynamic flows), flow travels through a network over time and, as a consequence, flow values on edges are time-dependent. This more realistic setting has not been tackled from the viewpoint of algorithmic game theory yet; but there is a rich literature on game theoretic aspects of flows over time in the traffic community. We present a novel characterization of Nash equilibria for flows over time. It turns out that Nash flows over time can be seen as a concatenation of special static flows. The underlying flow over time model is the so-called deterministic queuing model that is very popular in road traffic simulation and related fields. Based upon this, we prove the first known results on the price of anarchy for flows over time.},

In contrast to classical static flow problems, time plays a decisive role. Firstly, there are transit times on the arcs of the network which specify the amount of time it takes for flow to travel through a particular arc; more precisely, flow values on arcs may change over time. Secondly, the transit time of an arc varies with the current amount of flow using this arc. Especially the latter feature is crucial for various real-life applications of flows over time; yet, it dramatically increases the degree of difficulty of the resulting optimization problems. Most problems dealing with flows over time and constant transit times can be translated to static flow problems in time-expanded networks. We develop an alternative time-expanded network with flow-dependent transit times to which the whole algorithmic toolbox developed for static flows can be applied. Although this approach does not entirely capture the behavior of flows over time with flow-dependent transit times, we present approximation results which provide evidence of its surprising quality.},

Furthermore, this complexity bound is valid for any graph, regardless of the cost values. This generalizes Hassin's results which apply only to acyclic graphs.

Our algorithm is based on Hassin's original result with two improvements. First we modify Hassin's result and achieve time complexity of O({\textbar}E{\textbar}n(log log({UB}/{LB})+1/ε)), where {UB} and {LB} are upper and lower bounds for the problem. This modified version can be applied to general graphs with any cost values. Then we combine it with our second contribution, which shows how to find an upper and a lower bound such that {UB}/{LB}⩽n, to obtain the claimed result.},

In 1974 Hoffman pointed out that Ford and Fulkerson’s original proof was quite abstract, and applied to a wide range of flow problems. In this abstract model we have capacitated elements, and linearly ordered subsets of elements called paths. When two paths share an element (“cross”), then there must be a path that is a subset of the first path up to the cross and the second path after the cross. Hoffman’s generalization of Ford and Fulkerson’s proof showed that integral optimal primal and dual solutions still exist under this weak assumption. However, his proof is non-constructive.

Hoffman’s paper considers a sort of supermodular objective on the path flows, which allows him to include transportation problems and thus min-cost flow in his framework. We develop the first combinatorial polynomial algorithm that solves this problem, thereby also give a constructive proof of Hoffman’s theorem. Our algorithm accesses the network only through a dual feasibility oracle, and resembles the successive shortest path algorithm for ordinary min-cost flow. It uses some of the same techniques used to solve the max flow/min cut version of Hoffman’s model, plus a method to re-optimize when capacities change inside capacity scaling.},

	abstract = {The thesis discusses discrete-time dynamic flows over a finite time horizon T. These flows take time, called travel time, to pass an arc of the network. Travel times, as well as other network attributes, such as, costs, arc and node capacities, and supply at the source node, can be constant or time-dependent. Here we review results on discrete-time dynamic flow problems ({DTDNFP}) with constant attributes and develop new algorithms to solve several {DTDNFPs} with time-dependent attributes. Several dynamic network flow problems are discussed: maximum dynamic flow, earliest arrival flow, and quickest flow problems. We generalize the hybrid capacity scaling and shortest augmenting path algorithmic of the static network flow problem to consider the time dependency of the network attributes. The result is used to solve the maximum dynamic flow problem with time-dependent travel times and capacities. We also develop a new algorithm to solve earliest arrival flow problems with the same assumptions on the network attributes. The possibility to wait (or park) at a node before departing on outgoing arc is also taken into account. We prove that the complexity of new algorithm is reduced when infinite waiting is considered. We also report the computational analysis of this algorithm. The results are then used to solve quickest flow problems. Additionally, we discuss time-dependent bicriteria shortest path problems. Here we generalize the classical shortest path problems in two ways. We consider two - in general contradicting - objective functions and introduce a time dependency of the cost which is caused by a travel time on each arc. These problems have several interesting practical applications, but have not attained much attention in the literature. Here we develop two new algorithms in which one of them requires weaker assumptions as in previous research on the subject. Numerical tests show the superiority of the new algorithms. We then apply dynamic network flow models and their associated solution algorithms to determine lower bounds of the evacuation time, evacuation routes, and maximum capacities of inhabited areas with respect to safety requirements. As a macroscopic approach, our dynamic network flow models are mainly used to produce good lower bounds for the evacuation time and do not consider any individual behavior during the emergency situation. These bounds can be used to analyze existing buildings or help in the design phase of planning a building.},

It contains elegant combinatorial theory, useful and interesting algorithms, and deep results about the intrinsic complexity of combinatorial problems. Its clarity of exposition and excellent selection of exercises will make it accessible and appealing to all those with a taste for mathematics and algorithms. Richard Karp,University Professor, University of California at Berkeley Following the development of basic combinatorial optimization techniques in the 1960s and 1970s, a main open question was to develop a theory of approximation algorithms. In the 1990s, parallel developments in techniques for designing approximation algorithms as well as methods for proving hardness of approximation results have led to a beautiful theory. The need to solve truly large instances of computationally hard problems, such as those arising from the Internet or the human genome project, has also increased interest in this theory. The field is currently very active, with the toolbox of approximation algorithm design techniques getting always richer. It is a pleasure to recommend Vijay Vazirani's well-written and comprehensive book on this important and timely topic. I am sure the reader will find it most useful both as an introduction to approximability as well as a reference to the many aspects of approximation algorithms.

	abstract = {Bulk data migration between datacenters is often a critical step in deploying new services, improving reliability under failures, or implementing various cost reduction strategies for cloud companies. These bulk amounts of transferring data consume massive bandwidth, and further cause severe network congestion. Leveraging the temporal and spacial characteristics of inter-datacenter bulk data traffic, in this paper, we investigate the Multiple Bulk Data Transfers Scheduling ({MBDTS}) problem to reduce the network congestion. Temporally, we apply the store-and-forward transfer mode to reduce the peak traffic load on the link. Spatially, we propose to lexicographically minimize the congestion of all links among datacenters. To solve the {MBDTS} problem, we first model it as an optimization problem, and then propose a novel Elastic Time-Expanded Network technique to represent the time-varying network status as a static one with a reasonable expansion cost. Using this transformation, we reformulate the problem as a Linear Programming ({LP}) model, and obtain the optimal solution through iteratively solving the {LP} model. We have conducted extensive simulations on a real network topology. The results prove that our algorithm can significantly reduce the network congestion as well as balance the entire network traffic with practical computational costs.},

The approximation methods are “fully polynomial”; that is, they operate in time and space bounded by a polynomial in problem size and accuracy of approximation—the greater the accuracy, the more time required to reach a solution. We show how approximation methods may be applied to yield fully polynomial approximation schemes for a variety of {NP}-complete, single-objective problems.},

	doi = {10.1109/SFFCS.1999.814635},
	abstract = {We show that the all pairs shortest paths ({APSP}) problem for undirected graphs with integer edge weights taken from the range 1, 2, ..., M can be solved using only a logarithmic number of distance products of matrices with elements in the range (1, 2, ..., M). As a result, we get an algorithm for the {APSP} problem in such graphs that runs in O¯(Mnω) time, where n is the number of vertices in the input graph, M is the largest edge weight in the graph, and ω{\textless}2.376 is the exponent of matrix multiplication. This improves, and also simplifies, an O¯(M(ω+1)/2nω) time algorithm of Galil and Margalit (1997)},
